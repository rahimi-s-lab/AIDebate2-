Artificial intelligence (AI) is getting a lot of attention due to the large impact it has in different fields. However, there are a lot of myths and misconceptions associated with artificial intelligence. Debates and public talks on them tend to remove most of them.

One of the metric of a debate could be how much of the emotions it was able to change. In the study, we try to see the change in public opinion due to the debate of 23rd December, which will be attended by many prominent people in the field of AI.
Social media platforms provide great sources that can portray human emotions. Extracting data from those platforms for the study would give us an approximation of how popular the debate was and how it impacted public.
